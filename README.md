# DockerForMerge
This repo includes the code shown for my internal Blog post on utilizing Docker when merging old solutions

This Repo is made to run with Visual Studio Code or pure Powershell

All Powershellscripts are accessible via Tasks that support you a bit on using the scripts.

Please be aware it is an example and you have to adjust Images and things like that to fit your solution...

You most likely have to run VSC as Administrator...

## BC2019CU13.ps1
Task to run: Create BC 2019 Spring CU13!

You need to provide a incense filepath -> Small Tip: When you stand on a file in the file explorer hit in the top menu Home:Copy Path!
You will be asked for a user name and password (8char, 1 number, 1 spec. char, 1 upper case)

It will keep navcontainer up2date.

## Install-NavContainerHelper.ps1
Installs or Updates NavContainerhelper on it's own
